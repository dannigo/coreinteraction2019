    <ul>
        <li>This reading echoes my philosophy as a designer. As a designer, I aim to create a connection with the world by using design–or rather "treatment"–as a communicative vehicle. It is <i>how</i> I create that gives my work form. Through the creative choices I make, I give my work the ability to speak a visual language through the use of graphic storytelling devices. Messages are embedded within messages. Unspoken words are given a voice. So much power comes with being a designer–this is what motivates me to be one.</li>

        <li>How things are designed, and how design has changed over time, is a reflection of the changing world and how it correlates to the way people live. In a way, designers aid in reforming the world. Solutions take form through design. </li>
