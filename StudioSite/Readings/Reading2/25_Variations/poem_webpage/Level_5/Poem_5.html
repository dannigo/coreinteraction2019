      <h3>Little Black Cloud</h3><br>

    <p>If you were a cloud,<br>
    that one day,<br>
    wandered into space,<br>
    and got lost,<br>
    I would follow you.<br>

  <p>And if you were sucked into the<br>
    Milky Way and couldn't fly,<br>
    I would follow you there too.

<br>
  <div class="blackhole">
    <p><b>And if you were pulled<br>
    into a giant black hole,</b><br>
</div>
and it stole you through time and space,<br>
I would swim after you.

<br>

    <p>And time could pass,
    a million years,
    but I wouldn't stop swimming.

<br>

    <p>And one day, I would find you again,<br>
    the only little cloud in space.<br>
    And then I'd turn around and swim you home.

<br>

    <p>And when we got back,<br>
    I'd put you up in the sky<br>
    where you belong.

<br>

    <p>And I would sit by a tree and read a book,<br>
    just me and my little black cloud.
