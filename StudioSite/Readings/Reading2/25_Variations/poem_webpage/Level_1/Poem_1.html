    LITTLE BLACK CLOUD
    <p>If you were a cloud,<br>
    that one day,<br>
    wandered into space,<br>
    and got lost,<br>
    I would follow you.<br>
    <p>And if you were sucked into the Milky Way<br>
    and couldn't fly,<br>
    I would follow you there too.<br>
    <p>And if you were pulled<br>
    into a giant black hole,<br>
    and it stole you through time and space,<br>
    I would swim after you.<br>
    <p>And time could pass,<br>
    a million years,<br>
    but I wouldn't stop swimming.<br>
    <p>And one day, I would find you again,<br>
    the only little cloud in space.<br>
    And then I'd turn around and swim you home.<br>
    <p>And when we got back,<br>
    I'd put you up in the sky<br>
    where you belong.<br>
    <p>And I would sit by a tree and read a book,<br>
    just me and my little black cloud.<br>
    <p> - Atticus</p>
