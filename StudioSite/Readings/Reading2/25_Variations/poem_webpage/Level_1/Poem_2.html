    Little Black Cloud
    <p>If you were a cloud, that one day,<br>
    wandered<br>
    into space,<br>
    and got lost,<br>
    I would follow you.<br>

    <p>And if<br>
    you were sucked<br>
    into the Milky Way<br>
    and couldn't fly,<br>
    I would follow you there too.<br>

    <p>And if<br>
    you were pulled into<br>
    a giant<br>
    black<br>
    hole,<br>
    and it stole you<br>
    through time and space,<br>
    I would swim after you.<br>

    <p>And time<br>
    could pass, a million years,<br>
    but I wouldn't stop<br>
    swimming.<br>

    <p>And one day,<br>
    I would find you<br>
    again,<br>
    the only little<br>
    cloud in space.<br>
    And then<br>
    I'd turn around<br>
    and swim you home.<br>

    <p>And when we got back,<br>
    I'd put you<br>
    up in the sky<br>
    where you belong.<br>

    <p>And I would<br>
    sit by a tree<br>
    and read a book,<br>
    just me<br>
    and my little<br>
    black cloud.<br>
    <p>ATTICUS</p>
