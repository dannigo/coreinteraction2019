    LITTLE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLACK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOUD
    <p>If y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u were a cloud,<br>
    that one day, wandered into space,<br>
    and got lost,<br>
    I would follow y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u.<br>

    <p>And if y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u were sucked<br>
    into the Milky Way and couldn't fly,<br>
    I would follow y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u there too.<br>

    <p>And if y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u were pulled<br>
    into a giant black hole,and it stole y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u<br>
    through time and space,<br>
    I would swim after y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u.<br>

    <p>And time could pass, a million years,<br>
    but I wouldn't stop swimming.<br>

    <p>And one day, I would find y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u again,<br>
    the only<br>
    little cloud in space.<br>
    And then I'd turn around and swim y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u home.<br>

    <p>And when we got back,I'd put y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u<br>
    up in the sky where y&nbsp;o&nbsp;u belong.<br>

    <p>And I would sit by a tree<br>
    and read a book, just me<br>
    and my little black cloud.<br>
    <p> - a&nbsp;t&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;c&nbsp;u&nbsp;s
