                Daniel van der Velden
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>I really resonate with van Der Velden when he says, “Design is added value.” It’s true. When purchasing a product or form of service, you do not only pay for the benefits it holds or for the looks of it, but you pay for practicality, you pay for function. It is one thing for a product to “look the part” but ’s another if it does the part as well. The value you pay is quite literally the value of a better, more improved life.</li>
            <li>With that, I do think designers (in all fields), and even the profession itself, are taken for granted. There are people out there who do not seek value in pursuing a creative field (let alone an art major) when they are constantly surrounded by things that would not have into existence if it was not for a creative.</li>
        </ul>
