            <li>What medias to use in order to cater to an "image culture"</li>
            <li><a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/" target="_blank">This</a> is a website my Creative Computing TA from last semester showed my class. I love how it uses an endless scroll to navigate your way through the page, but more importantly, through the imagery. The imagery becomes part of the content and really engages the viewer, making them want to stay on the page longer.</li>
