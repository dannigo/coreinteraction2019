        <li>It’s interesting how the success of a meme is based on its ability to “withstand mutation” when I personally deem the strength of a meme based on its various replications. To me, variations of a meme reflect its success, as it usually means that it is versatile and can be made “relatable” in many ways.</li>
        <li>“Memes are not phenomena of language; they are phenomena with language. From words that simply “annotate” a meme, conveying its minimally required meaning in a given context, to words that become an integral part of the meme’s functioning.” This implies not only the visual culture present in today’s world, but the simply ability of visuals to speak for themselves, whether accompanied by text or not.</li>
