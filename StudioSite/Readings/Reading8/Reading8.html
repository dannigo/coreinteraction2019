    <ul>
        <li>Though time is "continuous," in a sense, it is a duration. It implies there is an "end" â€“ like how 24 hours marks the end of a day, or 365 days (8760 hours) mark the end of a year.</li>
        <li>The concepts of logosphere (the word), graphosphere (the book), and videosphere (the screen) shows the evolution and innovation of the means  of communication over time.</li>
        <li>Time reflects motion, from the physical ticking of a click to the changes in ourselves and our lives.</li>
    </ul>
