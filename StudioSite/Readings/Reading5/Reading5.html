        <ul>
            <li>There is this idea that the web, over time, changes. This reflects the changing world we are in today. Simultaneously, we, as people, change over time as well. With this, we become catalysts for how the internet changes. We are essentially the audience of the internet, but at the same time, we are also the makers of the internet. </li>
            <li>With how the internet is, people seek for individuality. People want to set their selves apart from each other, especially in the case where there is a problem of sites looking identical with one another (due to people “being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity”). This encourages people to break from tradition, to break from the mold, and create their own.</li>
