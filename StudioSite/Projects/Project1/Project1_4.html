                <p class="first"><span class="firstletter">A</span>nd so, the next interesting thing is that it’s founded by creatives: a dramatist/fashion designer/artist; an interactive artist/programmer, and a model. This explains their interest in collaborating with local artists, from physically displaying their work at their gallery-like space to getting their work printed on their cups. I sound like I’m trying to advertise them, which I guess I am, but I just have a huge appreciation for anyone and anything that support the arts. Oh, and I should mention that their drinks are delicious. From someone who is there a lot, I can honestly say that even their drinks are literal forms of art — you can physically see the attention to detail invested in it. For anyone reading this and wanting to try their drinks out, I highly recommend the Frida’s Still Life fruitea (and yes, they have drinks named after artists) and their maple lavender latté. I’m personally not a huge tea person (unless it’s chai, matcha, or bubble tea), so the fact that I keep coming back to this place means something. Also, was never a huge fan of lavender-flavored things until I had their latté, so again, that means something.</p>
