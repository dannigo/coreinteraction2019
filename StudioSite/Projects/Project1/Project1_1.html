                <p class="first"><span class="firstletter">I</span> still have photos from that trip, and it's insane to see that the places we went to then are now places I have been to countlessly since being here. There's a picture our family took at the Met with all of us huddled together in front of one of the huge flower arrangements. This was before I knew I would pursue art, so being at the Met didn't mean too much to me. Now, I can say that I have enjoyed every visit I have made at the Met, as I went there nearly every week fro class fiedltrips last school year, allowing me to truly appreciate the arts and the resources New York has to offer when it comes to the arts.</p>

                <p class="indent">A photo I find most interesting to this day was one of me at Washington Square Park, sitting on the grass and enjoying the summer sun, because little would my 14-year-old self know that just a couple blocks away was where I'd be spending four years of my life studying. And back then, I had no idea Parsons existed, nor did I think about graphic design (let alone know graphic design) being a passion I'd love and pursue.</p>
