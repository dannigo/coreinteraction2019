                <p class="first"><span class="firstletter">T</span>he thing is that I know that no matter what, Ken and I are still inseparable despite the distance between us. I've depended on him since day one â€“ and I mean that seriously as we became friends because we were in the same Math class, and I needed help so we became Starbucks study buddies a.k.a. the beginning of a life-long friendship. To this day, I know I can still depend on him. He has never failed to show me what loyalty is in a friendship. Even with other people, Ken always dedicates time and effort into the relationships and people he cares about.</p>

                <p class="indent">On another note, Ken educated me on the three main uses of "yeet" (which are celebration, affirmation, and aggression), the meaning of "yeet yaw," and the meaning of "yeet yeet yaw," so the usual. I can always count on him to have such inspiring, thought-provoking conversations with. (Please note sarcasm.)</p>
