                <p class="first"><span class="firstletter">I</span>can reassure you the call I got today wasn't as heavy as that one call, but still just as sad and emotional. It was a call with Ken, and to put it shortly, we just missed each other more than usual and both expressed our gratitude for each other.</p>

                <p class="indent">Both these calls, though very different from each other, have really served as a reminder to myself to not take the people that are in my life for granted. It's calls like these two that remind me that life is full of surprises, twists, and turns. However, despite these, you have people with you to help, guide, and support you through it all.</p>
