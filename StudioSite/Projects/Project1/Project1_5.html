                <p class="first"><span class="firstletter">Y</span>esterday, I attended an info session for the Italy study abroad program. Since learning about how Italy was one of the possible countries Communication Design majors could study in, it has been a priority of mine to inquire and make sure I knew everything there is to the program and the steps I need to take in order for my dreams of going to Italy to become a reality. I blame this on the Humanities class I took in high school as I got to learn about the rich art culture and architecture Italy has to offer. Just thinking of Baroque art gets me excited, what more getting to see it in person.
                </p>

                <p class="indent">To begin the info session, they played a video they put together of clips taken in Florence, giving us insight on the experience one would have at SACI, from showing parts of campus and student life to featuring the various opportunities the school has to offer such as class visits and fieldtrips to historical and cultural sites like Il Duomo. Clips of the streets of Florence were included, giving us a glimpse into the lifestyle in Florence. At certain parts, I felt myself trying to hide a smile because getting to see accounts and documentation of a place I have been dreaming to go to, and could potentially live and study in, filled me with so much excitement. I've always dreamed of going to Europe in general, and if studying in Italy is my ticket in, then sign. me. up.</p>
                
                <p class="indent">They also mentioned that there are 132 gelato flavors to try, so again, another reason why I should go.</p>
