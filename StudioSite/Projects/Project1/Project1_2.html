                <p class="first"><span class="firstletter">T</span>oday, I cried. It was 11am when I heard my phone ring from underneath my pillow. Do you ever have those moments where you look at the caller ID, know who's calling, and immediately smile because it's someone you care about? It was one of those moments. However, do you also have those moments where you answer a call, and the moment they speak, you sense something's wrong? It was also one of those moments.</p>

                <p class="indent">Before today, the last time I had such a call was, coincidentally, February 28 two years ago. I was at our local Starbucks for a study group session with my friends. I remember suddenly feeling something wasn't right. There was a weird sensation in my body, as if a part of it left, leaving me feeling empty almost. Following this was a call from my dad. His voice was calm and caring as he asked me where I was and when I'd be home. I told him I would be home as soon as I gave one of my friends a ride home, to which he just said to drive safely. I never thought anything of the calmness in his voice back then, but now, I look back knowing it masked a chaos about to ensue that night–or I guess ensued.</p>

                <p class="indent">As soon as I walked in the door, I was met by the sight of my dad and sister sitting together in the living room. Usually, by that time of night, they'd be in their room, so I knew something definitely was up. It was after I took a couple of steps inside when my dad says the words I had been dreading to hear: <em>"Wala na si Lolo."</em> Lolo's gone.</p>
