                <strong>Germany</strong> (German: Deutschland German pronunciation: [ˈdɔʏtʃlant]), officially the
                <strong>Federal Republic of Germany</strong> (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland, About this
                soundlisten (help·info)),[e] is a country in Central and Western Europe, lying between the
                Baltic and North Seas to the north, and the Alps to the south. It borders Denmark to the north,
                Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the south, France
                to the southwest, and Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands to the west. Germany
                includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of 357,386 square kilometres (137,988 sq mi),
                [4] and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With nearly 83 million inhabitants, it
                is the second most populous state of Europe after Russia, the most populous state lying
                entirely in Europe, as well as the most populous member state of the European Union.
                Germany is a very decentralized country. Its capital and largest metropolis is Berlin,
                while Frankfurt serves as its financial capital and has the country's busiest airport.
                Germany's largest urban area is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen.
                The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf,
                Leipzig, Dresden, Bremen, Hannover, and Nuremberg.

                <p>Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since
                classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During
                the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th
                century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire.[10]
                During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant
                Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was
                formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament
                establishing major democratic rights.</p>

                <p>n 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states (most notably
                excluding Switzerland and Austria) unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire.
                After World War I and the revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the
                parliamentary Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment
                of a dictatorship, the annexation of Austria, World War II, and the Holocaust. After the
                end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, Austria was
                re-established as an independent country and two new German states were founded: West
                Germany, formed from the American, British, and French occupation zones, and East
                Germany, formed from the Soviet occupation zone. Following the Revolutions of 1989
                that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified
                on 3 October 1990.[11]</p>

                <p>Today, the sovereign state of Germany is a federal parliamentary republic led by a
                chancellor. It is a great power with a strong economy; it has the world's fourth-largest
                economy by nominal GDP, and the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several
                industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and
                importer of goods. A developed country with a very high standard of living, it upholds
                a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection, and a
                tuition-free university education.</p>

                <p>The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the European Economic
                Community in 1957 and the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area
                and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United
                Nations, NATO, the G7, the G20, and the OECD. Known for its rich cultural history,
                Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists,
                philosophers, musicians, film people, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists,
                engineers, and inventors. Germany has a large number of World Heritage sites and is
                among the top tourism destinations in the world.</p>

                The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after
                Julius Caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine.[12] The German term
                Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ("the German lands") is derived from deutsch
                (compare Dutch), descended from Old High German diutisc "popular" (i.e. belonging
                to the diot or diota "people"), originally used to distinguish the language of the
                common people from Latin and its Romance descendants. This in turn descends from
                Proto-Germanic *þiudiskaz "popular" (see also the Latinised form Theodiscus), derived
                from *þeudō, descended from Proto-Indo-European *tewtéh₂- "people", from which the word
                Teutons also originates.[13]

           The discovery of the Mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at
           least 600,000 years ago.[14] The oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world
           were discovered in a coal mine in Schöningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were
           unearthed.[15] The Neander Valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human
           fossil was discovered; the new species of human was called the Neanderthal. The Neanderthal
           1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old. Evidence of modern humans, similarly dated, has
           been found in caves in the Swabian Jura near Ulm. The finds included 42,000-year-old bird
           bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[16] the
           40,000-year-old Ice Age Lion Man which is the oldest uncontested figurative art ever
           discovered,[17] and the 35,000-year-old Venus of Hohle Fels which is the oldest uncontested
           human figurative art ever discovered.[18] The Nebra sky disk is a bronze artefact created
           during the European Bronze Age attributed to a site near Nebra, Saxony-Anhalt. It is part of
           UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.[19]
