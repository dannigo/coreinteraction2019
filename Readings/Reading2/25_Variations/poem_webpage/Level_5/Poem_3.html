LITTLE BLACK CLOUD <br>- Atticus -
</div>

      <p>If you were a cloud,<br>
      that one day,<br>
      <div class="wandered">
      wandered into space,<br>
    </div><br>
    and got
    <div class="lost">
      lost,
    </div>
      I would follow you.<br>

      <br>

      <p>And if you were
        <div class="sucked">
      sucked into the Milky Way<br>
    </div><br>
      and couldn't
    <div class="fly">
    FLY
  </div>
      I would follow you there too.<br>

<br>

      <p>And if you were
<div class="pulled">
        pulled<br>
</div><br>
      into a<br>
      <div class="hole">
        giant black hole,<br>
      </div>
      and it stole you through time and space,<br>
      I would swim after you.<br>

<br>
<div class="time">
      <p>And time could pass,<br>
      a million years,<br>
      but I wouldn't stop swimming.<br>
</div>

<br>

      <p>And one day, I would find you again, the only<br>
      <div class="littlecloud1">
        little cloud
      </div>
        in space.<br>
      And then I'd turn around and swim you home.<br>

      <div class="last">
      <p>And when we got back,<br>
      I'd put you up in the sky<br>
      where you belong.<br>
      And I would sit by a tree and read a book,<br>
      just me and my little black cloud.<br>
