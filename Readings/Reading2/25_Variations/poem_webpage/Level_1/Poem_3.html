    <p>If you were a &nbsp;c&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;d,<br>
    that one day,<br>
    wandered into space,<br>
    and got lost,<br>
    <br>I would follow you.<br>
    <p>And if you were sucked into the M&nbsp;i&nbsp;l&nbsp;k&nbsp;y&nbsp;&nbsp;W&nbsp;a&nbsp;y<br>
    and couldn't fly,<br>
    <br>I would follow you there too.<br>
    <p>And if you were p&nbsp;u&nbsp;l&nbsp;l&nbsp;e&nbsp;d<br>
    into a giant black hole,<br>
    and it stole you through time and space,<br>
    <br>I would swim after you.<br>
    <p>And time could p&nbsp;a&nbsp;s&nbsp;s,<br>
    a million years,<br>
    but I wouldn't stop swimming.<br>
    <p>And one day, I would find you again,<br>
    the only little c&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;d in space.<br>
    And then I'd turn around and swim you home.<br>
    <p>And when we got back,<br>
    I'd put you up in the sky<br>
    <br>where you belong.<br>
    <p>And I would sit by a tree and read a book,<br>
    just me and my little black c&nbsp;l&nbsp;o&nbsp;u&nbsp;d.<br>
    <p> - Atticus
