    <p>If<br>
    you were a cloud, that<br>
    one day, wandered<br>
    into space, and<br>
    got lost,<br>
    I would follow you.<br>

    <p>And if<br>
    you<br>
    were sucked into<br>
    into the Milky Way and<br>
    couldn't fly,<br>
    I would follow you there too.<br>

    <p>And if<br>
    you<br>
    were pulled into<br>
    a giant<br>
    black hole,<br>
    and it stole you<br>
    through time<br>
    and space,<br>
    I would swim after you.<br>

    <p>And time<br>
    could pass,<br>
    a million years,<br>
    but I wouldn't stop swimming.<br>

    <p>And one day, I<br>
    would find you again,the only<br>
    little cloud in space.<br>
    And then<br>
    I'd turn around and swim you home.<br>

    <p>And<br>
    when we got back,<br>
    I'd put you up<br>
    in the sky where you belong.<br>

    <p>And<br>
    I would sit<br>
    by a tree and read a book,<br>
    just me and my<br>
    little black cloud.<br>
    <p> - A&nbsp;t&nbsp;t&nbsp;i&nbsp;c&nbsp;u&nbsp;s
