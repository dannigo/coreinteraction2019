            <li>She uses the process of collecting as a form of research in order to self-teach. Doing so allows her to use her findings as a link to other sources of information. By collecting different pieces of information in various forms, she creates interconnections to further her studies.</li>

            "Rutherford Chang on the Art of Collection"
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>His act of collecting allowed him to notice each object's finer details. Though they belong in the same system, each object had their own set of characteristics that set them apart from one another. By collecting from various sources, from various people, another component to his research was added. The social interactions that came with collecting guided him in curating what he wanted to collect.</li>

        <h1>
            "Ordinary Plenty" â€“ Jeremy Keith
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>He talks about collecting as an act of preservation. He advocates for self-autonomy when he points out that we ourselves are responsible for keeping certain objects, and that preserving it in a communal archive almost makes these objects lose their importance as they get lost in a sea of other objects. This almost implies the temporary state of certain objects and that there is no life-time guarantee for all of them.</li>
