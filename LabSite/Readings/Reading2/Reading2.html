            Responsive:
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Responsive web design is the ability for a site to adapt to various browsers. It is vital in achieving a cohesive browsing experience, regardless of where or how a site is being viewed. Some responsive designs maintain the same components but resize them to fit a smaller screen. Some also reduce the file sizes of the images to lessen the loading time of the page. However, responsive design does not entail keeping every single component. Some times, it means taking things away too. With responsive design, as the screen gets smaller, people gravitate towards the concept of “less is more”, where certain components are taken away, or are designed to not take up as much space, yet still maintain the original browsing environment. At the end of the day, responsive design is what you make it. How it becomes responsive is ultimately up to you.</li>

            Flexbox:
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Flexbox is essentially a method for layout. With Flexbox, creating grid-based systems becomes easier. Flexbox “flexes” in the sense that it efficiently lays out items within a container, aligning and distributing them equally. By using Flex, you are able to evenly lay out items even without providing specific sizes. Flexbox allows the container to fix their components’ width/height to properly fill the space provided, expanding items to maximize the space and shrinking items to avoid overflow.</li>
        </ul>
